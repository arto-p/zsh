# zsh
Some stuff for zsh

Here is some run-help helpers for certain commands, which allow use
some other commans/subcommands, e.g. git, xargs. Main idea is properly
process of main command's options:

  # sudo -u user vim<F1>

must call "man vim", not "man sudo".

  - run-help-docker
  - run-help-git
  - run-help-ip
  - run-help-sudo
  - run-help-xargs
